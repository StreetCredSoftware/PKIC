Officers continued verbal commands, and used an electronic control device (which can include a Taser or stun gun), physical force and a carotid restraint, a type of neck hold that restricts blood to the brain."""Gormley,Shane,,30,MALE,White,July,6,08:30,2015,24th St and D Ave,Ogden,UT,Utah State Highway Patrol,N,http://fox13now.com/2015/07/07/carjacking-suspect-in-custody-after-assaulting-woman-being-tased-having-heart-attack/,https://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=35397350,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/suspect-cardiac-arrest-stun-gun-arrest-dies-article-1.2292594,N,N,N,Taser,Cardiac Arrest,methamphetamine,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,Y,Y,U,Y,U,Y,U,U,Y,N,Y,N,Y,Y,Y,U,U,Y,Y,U,U,U,U,N,N,N,U,N,Y,U,U,U,http://fox13now.com/2015/07/07/carjacking-suspect-in-custody-after-assaulting-woman-being-tased-having-heart-attack/,https://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=35397350,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/suspect-cardiac-arrest-stun-gun-arrest-dies-article-1.2292594,N,N,N,N,N,"Mr Gormley was killed by the Utah State patrol when he suffered a heart attack after being TASED four times. As The Counted tells it, 'Gormley suffered a heart attack after being shocked with a Taser four times during a struggle with a trooper, according to authorities. After eluding capture by police several times in the preceding few days, following his escape from a jail work-release scheme, he beat an elderly woman and attempted to steal her car in an effort to escape from the trooper. He was placed into a coma in hospital but died a week later.' The important thing to note here is that officers attempted to protect Mr Gormley using less-lethal force despite the circumstances of his chase and subsequent arrest. And this is a great example of how context is important - as horrible as that Counted account makes Gormley sound, reality is much, much worse. Mr. Gormley had in fact been, as The Counted says, on work-release from jail (where he was serving time on a retail theft conviction); the 30 year old had escaped, then after stealing a motorcyle and getting stopped by the state police on a traffic charge, Gormley used the motorcycle to escape again. Gormley then stole a car from Wasatch Front Kia. According to FOX13, police, 'went to the apartment where Gormley's girlfriend lives near 24th St. and D Ave. in Ogden. They saw him jump from the apartment window and speed off in her car. Troopers chased Gormley to 21st St., where they boxed him in but he ran from the car and tried to carjack others. Authorities said he tried to carjack a truck and trailer but didn't get in.' Then, according to KSL.com, 'Investigators looking for Gormley found him Monday. He attempted to escape by jumping into a car driven by a 53-year-old woman. He punched, scratched and bit the woman in an attempt to get her out of the car, according to the UHP. Troopers used Tasers on Gormley four times before taking him into custody. After he was handcuffed, shackled and taken out of the car, Gormley went into cardiac arrest, according to the UHP. Gormley was taken to McKay-Dee Hospital Center where he was placed in a medically induced coma.' He later died. KSL continues, 'Tests showed [Gormley] was under the influence of methamphetamine and opiates at the time.' FOX13 reports that the medically induced coma was necessary precisely because of the amount of methamphetamine in Gormley's system.

According to police, they attempted to use beanbag rounds to subdue Deming before he escaped through back window, where officer Daniel Kunkel began following him. Police say the two wound up in a physical altercation after Kunkel's Taser failed to stop Deming, who wound up on top of the officer,'pummeling his head'. Kunkel claimed he was afraid he would lose consciousness and fired his weapon once at Deming's torso and again at his face when the initial shot failed to stop the attack.' Apparently the crime involved malicious mischief: according to ABC7, 'Specialty Sales Classics salesman Jeremy Bolen says the hood of a 1967 Mustang was scrawled on with a sharpie. The suspect even walked on a Cadillac worth $115,000. 'You can't repaint this,' he explained. 'There's a bunch of other damage. Graffiti in the bathroom,' he added.' NBC Bay Area continues, 'Initially police said Deming was found in front of the business, but clarified Tuesday he was still inside but could be seen through the dealership's large front windows. Deming allegedly threw a 50-pound floor jack through the window, which landed on the sidewalk near the officers. Police fired at him with a beanbag round but missed, and Deming refused commands to leave the dealership, police said.' Deming then ran out the back through a broken window. NBC continues, '[Officer Daniel] Kunkel was standing watch in the back of the business and saw Deming jump through the broken window. Kunkel ordered him to stop but Deming kept running, and Kunkel hit him in the back with a Taser, according to police. The Taser didn't stop Deming, and Kunkel started to chase him until Deming turned and charged Kunkel aggressively, police said Deming allegedly kicked Kunkel in the stomach and punched him in the head, knocking him to the ground. Deming got on top of Kunkel, pummeling his head as he lay on the concrete, police said.

When Vidro tried to arrest Davis, he took off running but was caught about 100 yards away. Instead of surrendering, Davis chose to fight with the officer, [Police Chief John] Mina said. 'Based on the physical evidence at the scene and radio transmissions, it appears there was a very, very violent struggle there,' Mina said. 'Our officer did use his Taser at some point during the struggle and a lot of his equipment, to include his Taser, baton, gun magazine, wristwatch and ball cap, were strewn about the scene of this violent struggle.' Mina said Vidro fired his gun one time, hitting Davis in the chest. Police attempted CPR until paramedics arrived.

Authorities said he was placed in the back of a patrol car, unhandcuffed, while officers ran his name. When the officers returned to handcuff Stewart and take him into custody for outstanding warrants, police said he became combative and struck an officer with the handcuffs. The officer then drew his gun and fired. Stewart's mother told local news that her son had never been arrested and that the warrants were for someone else with the same name.' WMC Television reported that, 'Investigators said when the officer opened the back door to handcuff Stewart, he kicked the door and attacked the officer.' I note that if the account is correct and the officer was moving to handcuff Stewart, then the officer would presumably have received, or believed he had received, confirmation on the arrest warrants, which WMC states were for a sexual offense in Iowa and another offense in Illinois. WMC continues, 'During the fight, Stewart grabbed the officer's handcuffs and swung them at him. The officer grabbed his gun and shot Stewart to end the fight. Stewart went to Regional Medical Center in critical condition where he later died. The officer had several cuts and bruises from the fight, but he did not need to go to the hospital. He is relieved of duty pending the outcome of this investigation.' The Memphis Flyer identified the officer as 26-year-old Connor Schilling, and noted that 'Schilling, who worked in the MPD's Ridgeway precinct, had a previous suspension for a DUI arrest in Southaven in July 2014 , but criminal charges were dismissed in that case. He did, however, receive departmental charges after the incident. His personnel file also contains one excessive force case in 2013 that was found to be not sustained by the MPD.'

In a frank assessment of the officer's conduct, Deters said Tensing had 'purposely killed' DuBose and that he 'should never have been a police officer'' Fox News reports that 'Deters says the shooting of motorist Samuel DuBose in a 'chicken crap' stop over a missing front license plate was 'asinine,' and 'without question a murder.' He also said the university shouldn't be in the policing business at all. The prosecutor said he thinks now-fired Officer Ray Tensing lost his temper because DuBose wouldn't get out of the car'.

The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported after an interview with Wolfstetter's father, 'One day before the Plymouth incident, police were called to Wolfsteller's grandparents' home for a mental health crisis, but his father said Monday that police couldn't take him to the hospital against his will.' They add about the incident two important details: first, 'an Arby's employee [had] called 911 about a disturbance and, Duane Wolfsteller said, several restaurant employees tackled his son to the ground.' Second, 'The BCA said that, according to the preliminary investigation, officer Amy Therkelsen responded to a report of a disturbance, and was told on the way that the man had a weapon and was inside the restaurant.

But police chiefs denied this, and said he sustained injuries during a physical fight involving no weapons. Sanders had been exercising his horse before the encounter with the officer, according to his family.' The Clarion-Ledger reported, ""We don't know why he was going after Jonathan, we don't know what the reason for stopping him was, we don't know what led up to this incident,' Parish said, adding that he hasn't been able to talk to all the eyewitnesses yet. That's when an altercation occurred.  Details are sketchy by all accounts. Early reports had Herrington using a flashlight to strangle Sanders, but both Street and Parish have since said there was no flashlight. Parish said as far as he knows, Sanders did not have a weapon, but that Sanders ended up strangled to death.' The Associated Press later reported, 'Stonewall Police Chief Michael Street said he has turned the inquiry over to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, as is typical when a police officer is involved in someone's death in Mississippi. Warren Strain, the spokesman for MBI, said an autopsy has been completed and that Sanders' body has been returned to his family. He said MBI has notified the FBI, which he described as 'offering support.' Strain said autopsy results are being analyzed and he can't release a cause of death. Street and Mitchell said MBI is likely to hold a news conference in coming days to discuss the autopsy's findings. Strain described the encounter between Herrington and Sanders as a physical 'altercation.""

'We know that he was hogtied and we know that he was placed face down on a stretcher, and we know a witness said he heard him say'I can't breathe.' We know he is an asthmatic and used an inhaler,' the police said. WHBQ continued by saying, 'We have also learned that the act of 'hogtieing' someone during arrest is used on a statewide level by law enforcement in Mississippi. It can be used by officers if a suspect could kick or otherwise injure an officer or EMT worker while being taken into custody.'
