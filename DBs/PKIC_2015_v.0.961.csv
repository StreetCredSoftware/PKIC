According to Berry, the video shows the suspect getting into the deputy's patrol car. The two struggled for control of the car; the deputy drew his handgun and continued to order the man to give up. Berry said the suspect tried to put the car into gear. Witnesses said they heard the car's engine rev. During the struggle for the car, the suspect's hand was near the deputy's loaded AR-15-style rifle, which was mounted in the car, Berry said. The suspect then tried to drive off with the deputy's hand stuck in the door. Broyles then made the decision to open fire. The first shot hit Judson in the left arm and went into his chest. Broyles managed to free himself from the car as Judson put the car into reverse. Broyles' second shot hit the door jam. The car crashed into an electrical tower. Broyles fired two more times. One bullet hit the passenger's door. The other struck Judson in the head. Judson died at the scene. 'Deputy Broyles at the time he fired his weapon was reasonably in fear for his own life.

According to police, they attempted to use beanbag rounds to subdue Deming before he escaped through back window, where officer Daniel Kunkel began following him. Police say the two wound up in a physical altercation after Kunkel's Taser failed to stop Deming, who wound up on top of the officer,'pummeling his head'. Kunkel claimed he was afraid he would lose consciousness and fired his weapon once at Deming's torso and again at his face when the initial shot failed to stop the attack.' Apparently the crime involved malicious mischief: according to ABC7, 'Specialty Sales Classics salesman Jeremy Bolen says the hood of a 1967 Mustang was scrawled on with a sharpie. The suspect even walked on a Cadillac worth $115,000. 'You can't repaint this,' he explained. 'There's a bunch of other damage. Graffiti in the bathroom,' he added.' NBC Bay Area continues, 'Initially police said Deming was found in front of the business, but clarified Tuesday he was still inside but could be seen through the dealership's large front windows. Deming allegedly threw a 50-pound floor jack through the window, which landed on the sidewalk near the officers. Police fired at him with a beanbag round but missed, and Deming refused commands to leave the dealership, police said.' Deming then ran out the back through a broken window. NBC continues, '[Officer Daniel] Kunkel was standing watch in the back of the business and saw Deming jump through the broken window. Kunkel ordered him to stop but Deming kept running, and Kunkel hit him in the back with a Taser, according to police. The Taser didn't stop Deming, and Kunkel started to chase him until Deming turned and charged Kunkel aggressively, police said Deming allegedly kicked Kunkel in the stomach and punched him in the head, knocking him to the ground. Deming got on top of Kunkel, pummeling his head as he lay on the concrete, police said. Kunkel thought he might lose consciousness and used his Taser again, but again it had no effect, so he drew his pistol and shot Deming once in the torso. However, even that didn't stop Deming and he continued his attack, police said. Kunkel then fired two more rounds, hitting Deming at least once in the face, police said.'"Johnny Ray Anderson,43,MALE,White,July,5,2015,12200 216th St,Hawaiian Gardens,CA,Knox County Sheriff's Office,N,Gunshot,,,,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,N,U,N,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,N,N,N,U,N,U,U,U,U,http://ktla.com/2015/07/06/alleged-prowler-who-was-possibly-unarmed-is-fatally-shot-by-sheriffs-deputies-in-hawaiian-gardens/,http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Sheriffs-Deputy-Shooting-Hawaiian-Gardens-311707311.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_LABrand,http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-0707-deputy-shootings-20150707-story.html,,N,N,N,N,"Police were responding to reports of a prowler in the neighborhood but have provided little details on the the circumstances before Anderson's death.

NBC Los Angeles reported, 'The family said Johnny Ray Anderson was knocking on the home's door because he wanted to escape authorities, but authorities said on Sunday that deputies came after the report of a prowler.'"Autumn Steele,34,FEMALE,White,January,6,2015,104 N Garfield Ave,Burlington,IA,"Osage Nation Police Department, Osage County Sheriff's Office",N,Gunshot,,,,U,U,U,MALE,N,N,N,U,N,N,N,N,U,U,U,U,U,U,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,U,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,U,N,http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2015/02/27/burlington-police-officer-cleared-fatal-shooting/24161985/,http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2015/01/07/officer-shoots-kills-burlington-woman/21403183/,http://www.kcci.com/news/neighbor-blames-dog-for-shooting-that-left-woman-dead/30576424,,N,N,N,N,"Steele and her husband, Gabriel Steele were in a domestic dispute and the officer was trying to break it up.

The officer had been called after reports of a fight in the area involving five men. The officer deployed his Taser and then fired his gun once, striking Davis. Davis later died in hospital,' reports The Counted. The Orlando Sentinel gives this account : 'Orlando police were called to the apartment complex near the intersection of Curry Ford Road and South Conway Road after a fight broke out among five people, including Davis. When Vidro tried to arrest Davis, he took off running but was caught about 100 yards away. Instead of surrendering, Davis chose to fight with the officer, [Police Chief John] Mina said. 'Based on the physical evidence at the scene and radio transmissions, it appears there was a very, very violent struggle there,' Mina said. 'Our officer did use his Taser at some point during the struggle and a lot of his equipment, to include his Taser, baton, gun magazine, wristwatch and ball cap, were strewn about the scene of this violent struggle.' Mina said Vidro fired his gun one time, hitting Davis in the chest. Police attempted CPR until paramedics arrived. Davis was taken to a local hospital, where he was first listed in critical condition, then later died.'

Authorities said he was placed in the back of a patrol car, unhandcuffed, while officers ran his name. When the officers returned to handcuff Stewart and take him into custody for outstanding warrants, police said he became combative and struck an officer with the handcuffs. The officer then drew his gun and fired. Stewart's mother told local news that her son had never been arrested and that the warrants were for someone else with the same name.' WMC Television reported that, 'Investigators said when the officer opened the back door to handcuff Stewart, he kicked the door and attacked the officer.' I note that if the account is correct and the officer was moving to handcuff Stewart, then the officer would presumably have received, or believed he had received, confirmation on the arrest warrants, which WMC states were for a sexual offense in Iowa and another offense in Illinois. WMC continues, 'During the fight, Stewart grabbed the officer's handcuffs and swung them at him. The officer grabbed his gun and shot Stewart to end the fight. Stewart went to Regional Medical Center in critical condition where he later died. The officer had several cuts and bruises from the fight, but he did not need to go to the hospital. He is relieved of duty pending the outcome of this investigation.'

Authorities said Van De Putte was walking against the traffic signal.' This is another horrible accident that seems to be added to this database for the purposes of inflating the numbers. But in this case, it is so obviously biased against the officer that it neglects even in its brief description to mention that it was 3:40 am at the time of the accident, and it mischaracterizes as 'authorities said' a witness report stating that Mr. van de Putte was crossing against the signal, and neglects entirely to mention that the officer tried to avoid Mr. van de Putte to the extent that he crashed his patrol car into a utility pole. The Asbury Park Press reported, 'Lacey Police Officer Andrew Slota was responding to a call and traveling East on Lacey Road when his patrol car struck Vandeputt before veering off the road and into a utility pole following an evasive maneuver by the officer. Witnesses to the incident indicated that Vandeputt was crossing against the traffic signal to the north of Lacey Road at the Deerhead Lake intersection when he was struck by Slotta, [Ocean County Prosecutor's Office spokesman Al] Della Fave said. According to Della Fave, though Slota attempted to avoid Vandeputt, the pedestrian was struck by the front passenger side of the patrol vehicle, and after impact the vehicle struck a utility pole on the westbound side of the road, eventually coming to rest in the bank parking lot adjacent to the roadway. Vandeputt was pronounced dead at the scene by Dr. Konomos from Newark Beth Israel at 3:47 a.m. Slota was taken to Community Medical Center where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.'

As The Counted tells it, 'Gormley suffered a heart attack after being shocked with a Taser four times during a struggle with a trooper, according to authorities. After eluding capture by police several times in the preceding few days, following his escape from a jail work-release scheme, he beat an elderly woman and attempted to steal her car in an effort to escape from the trooper. He was placed into a coma in hospital but died a week later.' The important thing to note here is that officers attempted to protect Mr Gormley using less-lethal force despite the circumstances of his chase and subsequent arrest. And this is a great example of how context is important_‹_as horrible as that Counted account makes Gormley sound, reality is much, much worse. Mr. Gormley had in fact been, as The Counted says, on work-release from jail (where he was serving time on a retail theft conviction); the 30 year old had escaped, then after stealing a motorcyle and getting stopped by the state police on a traffic charge, Gormley used the motorcycle to escape again. Gormley then stole a car from Wasatch Front Kia. According to FOX13, police, 'went to the apartment where Gormley's girlfriend lives near 24th St. and D Ave. in Ogden. They saw him jump from the apartment window and speed off in her car. Troopers chased Gormley to 21st St., where they boxed him in but he ran from the car and tried to carjack others. Authorities said he tried to carjack a truck and trailer but didn't get in.' Then, according to KSL.com, 'Investigators looking for Gormley found him Monday. He attempted to escape by jumping into a car driven by a 53-year-old woman. He punched, scratched and bit the woman in an attempt to get her out of the car, according to the UHP. Troopers used Tasers on Gormley four times before taking him into custody. After he was handcuffed, shackled and taken out of the car, Gormley went into cardiac arrest, according to the UHP. Gormley was taken to McKay-Dee Hospital Center where he was placed in a medically induced coma.' He later died. KSL continues, 'Tests showed [Gormley] was under the influence of methamphetamine and opiates at the time.' FOX13 reports that the medically induced coma was necessary precisely because of the amount of methamphetamine in Gormley's system.
