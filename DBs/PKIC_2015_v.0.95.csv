According to police, they attempted to use beanbag rounds to subdue Deming before he escaped through back window, where officer Daniel Kunkel began following him. Police say the two wound up in a physical altercation after KunkelÍs Taser failed to stop Deming, who wound up on top of the officer, ïpummeling his headÍ. Kunkel claimed he was afraid he would lose consciousness and fired his weapon once at DemingÍs torso and again at his face when the initial shot failed to stop the attack.î Apparently the crime involved malicious mischief: according to ABC7, ñSpecialty Sales Classics salesman Jeremy Bolen says the hood of a 1967 Mustang was scrawled on with a sharpie.

The Taser didnÍt stop Deming, and Kunkel started to chase him until Deming turned and charged Kunkel aggressively, police said Deming allegedly kicked Kunkel in the stomach and punched him in the head, knocking him to the ground. Deming got on top of Kunkel, pummeling his head as he lay on the concrete, police said. Kunkel thought he might lose consciousness and used his Taser again, but again it had no effect, so he drew his pistol and shot Deming once in the torso.

The Asbury Park Press reported, ñLacey Police Officer Andrew Slota was responding to a call and traveling East on Lacey Road when his patrol car struck Vandeputt before veering off the road and into a utility pole following an evasive maneuver by the officer. Witnesses to the incident indicated that Vandeputt was crossing against the traffic signal to the north of Lacey Road at the Deerhead Lake intersection when he was struck by Slotta, [Ocean County ProsecutorÍs Office spokesman Al] Della Fave said.

After eluding capture by police several times in the preceding few days, following his escape from a jail work-release scheme, he beat an elderly woman and attempted to steal her car in an effort to escape from the trooper. He was placed into a coma in hospital but died a week later.î The important thing to note here is that officers attempted to protect Mr Gormley using less-lethal force despite the circumstances of his chase and subsequent arrest. And this is a great example of how context is important_„_as horrible as that Counted account makes Gormley sound, reality is much, much worse. Mr. Gormley had in fact been, as The Counted says, on work-release from jail (where he was serving time on a retail theft conviction); the 30 year old had escaped, then after stealing a motorcyle and getting stopped by the state police on a traffic charge, Gormley used the motorcycle to escape again. Gormley then stole a car from Wasatch Front Kia. According to FOX13, police, ñwent to the apartment where GormleyÍs girlfriend lives near 24th St. and D Ave. in Ogden. They saw him jump from the apartment window and speed off in her car. Troopers chased Gormley to 21st St., where they boxed him in but he ran from the car and tried to carjack others. Authorities said he tried to carjack a truck and trailer but didnÍt get in.î Then, according to KSL.com, ñInvestigators looking for Gormley found him Monday. He attempted to escape by jumping into a car driven by a 53-year-old woman. He punched, scratched and bit the woman in an attempt to get her out of the car, according to the UHP. Troopers used Tasers on Gormley four times before taking him into custody. After he was handcuffed, shackled and taken out of the car, Gormley went into cardiac arrest, according to the UHP. Gormley was taken to McKay-Dee Hospital Center where he was placed in a medically induced coma.î He later died. KSL continues, ñTests showed [Gormley] was under the influence of methamphetamine and opiates at the time.î FOX13 reports that the medically induced coma was necessary precisely because of the amount of methamphetamine in GormleyÍs system.
