Berry said during a foot chase the suspect ignored repeated commands to 'stop' and 'get on the ground.' The deputy fired his stun gun, but it failed to stop the suspect. According to Berry, the video shows the suspect getting into the deputy's patrol car. The two struggled for control of the car; the deputy drew his handgun and continued to order the man to give up. Berry said the suspect tried to put the car into gear. Witnesses said they heard the car's engine rev. During the struggle for the car, the suspect's hand was near the deputy's loaded AR-15-style rifle, which was mounted in the car, Berry said. The suspect then tried to drive off with the deputy's hand stuck in the door. Broyles then made the decision to open fire. The first shot hit Judson in the left arm and went into his chest. Broyles managed to free himself from the car as Judson put the car into reverse. Broyles' second shot hit the door jam. The car crashed into an electrical tower. Broyles fired two more times. One bullet hit the passenger's door. The other struck Judson in the head. Judson died at the scene. 'Deputy Broyles at the time he fired his weapon was reasonably in fear for his own life.

NBC Los Angeles reports (and this is in the video, not the written story accompanying the video) that an unnamed witness, 'the neighbor who called authorities' who 'did not want to go on camera but said that Siqueiros was, 'acting strangely' and that his eyes were glazed over. Police ordered him to the ground and the man who called in the authorities said that the arest was orderly and not forceful.'

Kunkel claimed he was afraid he would lose consciousness and fired his weapon once at Deming's torso and again at his face when the initial shot failed to stop the attack.' Apparently the crime involved malicious mischief: according to ABC7, 'Specialty Sales Classics salesman Jeremy Bolen says the hood of a 1967 Mustang was scrawled on with a sharpie. The suspect even walked on a Cadillac worth $115,000. 'You can't repaint this,' he explained. 'There's a bunch of other damage. Graffiti in the bathroom,' he added.' NBC Bay Area continues, 'Initially police said Deming was found in front of the business, but clarified Tuesday he was still inside but could be seen through the dealership's large front windows. Deming allegedly threw a 50-pound floor jack through the window, which landed on the sidewalk near the officers. Police fired at him with a beanbag round but missed, and Deming refused commands to leave the dealership, police said.' Deming then ran out the back through a broken window. NBC continues, '[Officer Daniel] Kunkel was standing watch in the back of the business and saw Deming jump through the broken window. Kunkel ordered him to stop but Deming kept running, and Kunkel hit him in the back with a Taser, according to police. The Taser didn't stop Deming, and Kunkel started to chase him until Deming turned and charged Kunkel aggressively, police said Deming allegedly kicked Kunkel in the stomach and punched him in the head, knocking him to the ground. Deming got on top of Kunkel, pummeling his head as he lay on the concrete, police said. Kunkel thought he might lose consciousness and used his Taser again, but again it had no effect, so he drew his pistol and shot Deming once in the torso. However, even that didn't stop Deming and he continued his attack, police said. Kunkel then fired two more rounds, hitting Deming at least once in the face, police said.'"Van De Putte,Neil,,25,MALE,White,July,5,03:45,2015,Lacey Rd and Deerhead Lake Dr,Lacey Township,NJ,Lacey Township Police Department,N,N,Y,Struck by vehicle,U,U,U,U,N,N,U,N,N,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,N,U,N,U,U,U,U,U,U,Y,U,Y,U,U,Y,N,N,Y,N,U,U,U,U,http://www.app.com/story/news/local/ocean-county/2015/07/05/lacey-police-officer-strikes-kills-pedestrian/29753063/,http://patch.com/new-jersey/berkeley-nj/neil-torian-van-de-putte-toms-river-dies-25,,U,N,N,N,N,"The Counted notes that, 'While crossing a street, Van De Putte was struck by a police patrol car being driven by an officer who was responding to an unrelated call. Authorities said Van De Putte was walking against the traffic signal.' This is another horrible accident that seems to be added to this database for the purposes of inflating the numbers. But in this case, it is so obviously biased against the officer that it neglects even in its brief description to mention that it was 3:40 am at the time of the accident, and it mischaracterizes as 'authorities said' a witness report stating that Mr. van de Putte was crossing against the signal, and neglects entirely to mention that the officer tried to avoid Mr. van de Putte to the extent that he crashed his patrol car into a utility pole. The Asbury Park Press reported, 'Lacey Police Officer Andrew Slota was responding to a call and traveling East on Lacey Road when his patrol car struck Vandeputt before veering off the road and into a utility pole following an evasive maneuver by the officer. Witnesses to the incident indicated that Vandeputt was crossing against the traffic signal to the north of Lacey Road at the Deerhead Lake intersection when he was struck by Slotta, [Ocean County Prosecutor's Office spokesman Al] Della Fave said. According to Della Fave, though Slota attempted to avoid Vandeputt, the pedestrian was struck by the front passenger side of the patrol vehicle, and after impact the vehicle struck a utility pole on the westbound side of the road, eventually coming to rest in the bank parking lot adjacent to the roadway. Vandeputt was pronounced dead at the scene by Dr. Konomos from Newark Beth Israel at 3:47 a.m. Slota was taken to Community Medical Center where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.'

As The Counted tells it, 'Gormley suffered a heart attack after being shocked with a Taser four times during a struggle with a trooper, according to authorities. After eluding capture by police several times in the preceding few days, following his escape from a jail work-release scheme, he beat an elderly woman and attempted to steal her car in an effort to escape from the trooper. He was placed into a coma in hospital but died a week later.' The important thing to note here is that officers attempted to protect Mr Gormley using less-lethal force despite the circumstances of his chase and subsequent arrest. And this is a great example of how context is important___as horrible as that Counted account makes Gormley sound, reality is much, much worse. Mr. Gormley had in fact been, as The Counted says, on work-release from jail (where he was serving time on a retail theft conviction); the 30 year old had escaped, then after stealing a motorcyle and getting stopped by the state police on a traffic charge, Gormley used the motorcycle to escape again. Gormley then stole a car from Wasatch Front Kia. According to FOX13, police, 'went to the apartment where Gormley's girlfriend lives near 24th St. and D Ave. in Ogden. They saw him jump from the apartment window and speed off in her car. Troopers chased Gormley to 21st St., where they boxed him in but he ran from the car and tried to carjack others. Authorities said he tried to carjack a truck and trailer but didn't get in.' Then, according to KSL.com, 'Investigators looking for Gormley found him Monday. He attempted to escape by jumping into a car driven by a 53-year-old woman. He punched, scratched and bit the woman in an attempt to get her out of the car, according to the UHP. Troopers used Tasers on Gormley four times before taking him into custody. After he was handcuffed, shackled and taken out of the car, Gormley went into cardiac arrest, according to the UHP. Gormley was taken to McKay-Dee Hospital Center where he was placed in a medically induced coma.' He later died. KSL continues, 'Tests showed [Gormley] was under the influence of methamphetamine and opiates at the time.' FOX13 reports that the medically induced coma was necessary precisely because of the amount of methamphetamine in Gormley's system.

That's when an altercation occurred.  Details are sketchy by all accounts. Early reports had Herrington using a flashlight to strangle Sanders, but both Street and Parish have since said there was no flashlight. Parish said as far as he knows, Sanders did not have a weapon, but that Sanders ended up strangled to death.' The Associated Press later reported, 'Stonewall Police Chief Michael Street said he has turned the inquiry over to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, as is typical when a police officer is involved in someone's death in Mississippi. Warren Strain, the spokesman for MBI, said an autopsy has been completed and that Sanders' body has been returned to his family. He said MBI has notified the FBI, which he described as 'offering support.' Strain said autopsy results are being analyzed and he can't release a cause of death.
