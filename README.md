<p>The StreetCred<sup>&reg;</sup> Police Killings in Context (PKIC) database is a peer-reviewed, open-standard database, provided in comma-separated values format, that includes incidents in which a civilian was killed in the United States during an encounter with a police officer acting in an official capacity (whether on-, or off-duty), not including vehicular accidents or deaths in jail (post-booking) or prison. StreetCred PKIC provides, in as transparent and accurate terms as possible, contextually relevant facts on deadly force incidents to enable serious researchers, reporters, legislators, and agency administrators to understand issues of improper police use of deadly force. </p>

<p>Documentation is available at <a href="http://streetcredsoftware.com/pkic" target="_blank">http://streetcredsoftware.com/pkic</a>. The data is available <a href="https://github.com/streetcredsoftware/PKIC" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a></strong></p>
