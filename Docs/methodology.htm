<h2>StreetCred<sup>&reg;</sup> Police Killings in Context Methodology</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The StreetCred<sup>&reg;</sup> Police Killings in Context (PKIC) dataset was populated through a range of sources.  As others have rightly noted, there is no compulsory national accounting by the United States government of killings by police officers of civilians. StreetCred supports the creation of such a system.</p>

<p>To compile this dataset, we began by using datasets put forth by reputable private entities. These include The Guardian's <a href="www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database" target="_blank">The Counted: People killed by police in the US</a> database; the Washington Post's <a href="www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2015/06/30/distraught-people-deadly-results/" target="_blank">Distraught People, Deadly Results</a> database, and the <a href="http://www.fatalencounters.org/" target="_blank">Fatal Encounters</a> database. 

<p>Using our subject matter expertise in law enforcement and use of force (many of us are current or former police officers, detectives, crime analysts and agency administrators), we added columns that would provide contextually relevant, factual data-points, without drawing conclusions. </p>

<p>Our goal is to give stakeholders &mdash; community members, activists, police departments, city administrations, scholars, policy-makers and researchers &mdash; another tool to better understand whether law enforcement is treating fairly and justly those it is sworn to protect. We do not seek to stanch criticism or suppress controversy; on the contrary, our goal is to produce clean, clear and actionable data that both sides can use to debate intelligently and meaningfully the way forward. </p>

<p><strong>StreetCred PKIC does not draw conclusions as to culpability or blame for any incident, and has no opinion on any incident or its outcome.</strong> The dataset is maintained enitirely separate from any analysis by any party (including StreetCred Software, Inc.) of any datum or data within. The data within this dataset are intended to be factual, open and peer-reviewed. A mechanism for publishing corrections and errata is provided.</p>

<p>We do all this with the hope that our work will inform police procedures, policies and the training of both new and veteran officers, as well as to inform the criteria by which future incidents of deadly force are examined.</p>

<h3>Sources</h3>
This project seeks relevant, factual, non-biased news sources. The source of each data entry should be documented, in the dataset (Links columns) and/or bibliography (in cses when all three links columns are already occupied). The order in which sources are checked, trusted and then used are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Official Coroner reports, releases, or statements;</li>
  <li>Official district or county or state attorney reports, releases, or statements;</li>
  <li>Grand jury reports, records, transcripts, indictments, or evidence;</li>
  <li>Official police reports, statements, or releases;</li>
  <li>News reports (print, web or television/video) by reputable news sources that quote more than one source and do not have a demonstrable bias towards any given version of the story.</li>
</ol>

<p>By focusing on these sources, in the order stated, StreetCred PKIC makes every effort to remain unbiased and factual. </p>

<p>In general, local televsion news, local newspaper and news sites and other traditional local, county, state, regional and national news sources provide acceptable depth and acceptably unbiased reporting to be included as primary or secondary sources. In certain cases, articles in various Patch outlets, New York Newsday, The Daily Kos, The Washington Times, The Guardian (UK), PhotographyIsNotACrime, etc., are acceptable only as secondary sources. Articles on the websites of groups with an overt agenda - CopBlock, We Support Our Police, CopWatch and similar groups - are not acceptable except in cases in which there are no other sources and there is evidence that an event occurred.</p>

<h3>Race</h3>
<p>Almost all news reports report on the race of the decedent. The race of the officer(s) involved are less frequently stated. In order to determine the race of the officer involved, we read primary and secondary sources seeking specific articulation of the race of the officer. This includes sentences such as, "Officer X, who is white..." or the like. Other constructs, such as, "Mr Y, a black man, was killed by a white police officer," are only acceptable if the source provides further information about the provenance of this determination. We have read several news articles that state constructs like that in cases that turned out to be false - the officer was in fact not the stated race. Further information can be the name of the officer and his rank, or, if the name is not released, a reference to an official statement by police that contains the racial characteristics of the officer involved. A photo of the officer in an article that is not accompanied by a specific statement of the race of the officer is not acceptable evidence of the race of the officer. 

<h3>Gender</h3>
<p>Almost all news reports report on the gender of the decedent. The gender of the officer(s) involved are less frequently stated. In order to determine the gender of the officer involved, we read primary and secondary sources seeking specific articulation of the gender of the officer, however this is not <em>as</em> specific as race. Many articles will specifically state "female officer," while others will indirectly state it, for example, "Police have not released the name of the officer involved in the shooting, but state she is a six-year veteran of the force," or "Police say the officer deployed his TASER..."  It is also marginally acceptable to infer the gender of the officer through the officer's obviously male or female name, such as "Michael" or "Elizabeth," however great care must be taken when dealing with names that are dual-gender in the American culture, such as "Ashley," "Blair", "Sydney," and the like.
